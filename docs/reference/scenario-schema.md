# Scenario Schema Reference

Complete reference for scenario files — the YAML files that define failure simulations.

## Anatomy of a scenario

```yaml
name: <string>              # required — scenario name (shown in output)
description: <string>       # optional — what this scenario tests and why

inject:                     # required — synthetic facts to feed the engine
  <component-name>:
    <fact-name>: <value>

expect:                     # required — what the engine should conclude
  root_cause: <component-name> | none
  path: [<component>, ...]  # optional — failure path from outermost to root cause
  eliminated: [<component>, ...]  # optional — components confirmed healthy
```

## Fields

### `name`

**Required.** Displayed in `mgtt simulate` output. Keep it short and descriptive.

```yaml
name: rds unavailable
```

### `description`

**Optional.** Explains what the scenario tests and why the expected outcome is correct. Useful for documentation — the engine ignores it.

```yaml
description: >
  rds stops accepting connections. api crash-loops as a result.
  engine should trace the fault to rds, not api.
```

### `inject`

**Required.** A map of component names to fact/value pairs. These synthetic facts replace what live probes would collect.

```yaml
inject:
  rds:
    available: false
    connection_count: 0
  api:
    ready_replicas: 0
    restart_count: 12
    desired_replicas: 3
```

**Fact names** must match facts defined by the provider for that component's type. See the [Type Catalog](type-catalog.md) for which facts each type exposes.

**Value types** match the fact's declared type:

| Fact type | Example values |
|-----------|---------------|
| `mgtt.bool` | `true`, `false` |
| `mgtt.int` | `0`, `42`, `500` |
| `mgtt.float` | `0.95`, `42.5` |
| `mgtt.string` | `"running"`, `"error"` |

**Components not listed in `inject`** are treated as having no observed facts. The engine cannot determine their state and will not eliminate them unless all their facts can be inferred from provider defaults.

!!! tip "Inject enough facts for state resolution"
    Each provider type has state definitions with conditions (e.g., `degraded: ready_replicas < desired_replicas & restart_count > 5`). If you inject `ready_replicas: 0` without `restart_count`, the engine may resolve the state as `starting` instead of `degraded`. See [Type Catalog](type-catalog.md) for each type's state conditions.

### `expect`

**Required.** Assertions about what the engine should conclude.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `root_cause` | yes | The component the engine identifies as root cause. Use `none` when all components are healthy. |
| `path` | no | The failure path from outermost component to root cause. Order: `[outermost, ..., root_cause]`. |
| `eliminated` | no | Components confirmed healthy and removed from investigation. |

```yaml
expect:
  root_cause: rds
  path: [nginx, api, rds]
  eliminated: [frontend]
```

When `root_cause: none`, the engine should find no failures:

```yaml
expect:
  root_cause: none
  eliminated: [nginx, frontend, api, rds]
```

!!! note "How `eliminated` works"
    **Order doesn't matter.** The `eliminated` comparison is order-insensitive — `[frontend, rds]` and `[rds, frontend]` are equivalent. Write them in whatever order makes sense to you.

    **Only traversed components appear.** The engine only reports components on branches it actually explored. If your model has a component that isn't reachable from the failure path (e.g., a cron job with no dependency relationship to the affected components), it won't appear in `eliminated` even if it's healthy. Only components the engine investigated and confirmed healthy are listed.

## File location

Place scenarios in a `scenarios/` directory alongside your model:

```
your-project/
├── system.model.yaml
└── scenarios/
    ├── rds-unavailable.yaml
    ├── api-crash-loop.yaml
    └── all-healthy.yaml
```

## Running scenarios

```bash
mgtt simulate --all                        # run all scenarios in scenarios/
mgtt simulate --scenario scenarios/rds-unavailable.yaml  # run one
```

## Example: complete scenario set

### Database failure cascades to API

```yaml
# scenarios/rds-unavailable.yaml
name: rds unavailable
description: >
  rds stops accepting connections. api crash-loops as a result.
  engine should trace the fault to rds, not api.

inject:
  rds:
    available: false
    connection_count: 0
  api:
    ready_replicas: 0
    restart_count: 12
    desired_replicas: 3

expect:
  root_cause: rds
  path: [nginx, api, rds]
  eliminated: [frontend]
```

### Application bug (database healthy)

```yaml
# scenarios/api-crash-loop.yaml
name: api crash-loop independent of rds
description: >
  api crash-loops due to a code error. rds is healthy.

inject:
  api:
    ready_replicas: 0
    restart_count: 24
    desired_replicas: 3
  rds:
    available: true
    connection_count: 120

expect:
  root_cause: api
  path: [nginx, api]
  eliminated: [rds, frontend]
```

### Frontend isolated failure

```yaml
# scenarios/frontend-degraded.yaml
name: frontend crash-looping, api healthy
description: >
  frontend pods are crash-looping. api and rds are healthy.

inject:
  frontend:
    ready_replicas: 0
    restart_count: 8
    desired_replicas: 2
  api:
    ready_replicas: 3
    desired_replicas: 3
    endpoints: 3
  rds:
    available: true
    connection_count: 98

expect:
  root_cause: frontend
  path: [nginx, frontend]
  eliminated: [api, rds]
```

### No false positives

```yaml
# scenarios/all-healthy.yaml
name: all components healthy
description: verifies the engine does not surface false positives.

inject:
  nginx:
    upstream_count: 4
  frontend:
    ready_replicas: 2
    desired_replicas: 2
    endpoints: 2
  api:
    ready_replicas: 3
    desired_replicas: 3
    endpoints: 3
  rds:
    available: true
    connection_count: 87

expect:
  root_cause: none
  eliminated: [nginx, frontend, api, rds]
```

## Common mistake: per-component status assertions

The `expect` block describes the engine's **overall conclusion**, not per-component status. This is wrong:

```yaml
# WRONG — this is not how expect works
expect:
  api:
    status: degraded
  rds:
    status: healthy
  frontend:
    status: healthy
```

The correct format asserts the engine's conclusion — root cause, failure path, and eliminated components:

```yaml
# CORRECT
expect:
  root_cause: api
  path: [nginx, api]
  eliminated: [rds, frontend]
```

The engine determines component states internally from the injected facts. You assert what the engine should *conclude*, not what each component's state should be.

---

## What a failing scenario teaches you

A simulation failure means the engine's conclusion doesn't match your expectation. Common causes:

- **Missing facts in `inject`** — the engine can't determine state without enough facts. Example: injecting `ready_replicas: 0` without `restart_count` makes the engine see `starting` instead of `degraded`.
- **Wrong `expect`** — your assertion doesn't match how the dependency graph actually propagates failures.
- **Model gap** — a missing dependency in `system.model.yaml` means the engine can't trace the failure path.

Each failure reveals something about the model or your understanding of it — at design time, not at 3am.
