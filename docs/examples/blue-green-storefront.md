# Blue/green storefront on EKS

A complete, non-trivial mgtt walkthrough based on a real production e-commerce platform. PHP-FPM behind nginx, blue/green traffic switching, an async queue tier, scheduled cron, and an AWS-managed data layer (RDS + ElastiCache + AmazonMQ + S3 + CloudFront).

This page is a walkthrough, not a reference. It shows how a working engineer reaches the model you see here — including the places where the first attempt was wrong and had to be refined.

## The system

`acme-shop` is a storefront serving `shop.acme.example`. Deployed on EKS with blue/green traffic switching: two identical deployment sets (`color: blue`, `color: green`) run side-by-side, and a single `Service` (`acme-shop-svc`) points its selector at whichever color is live.

<!-- Source: docs/images/blue-green-storefront.d2 — regenerate with `d2 docs/images/blue-green-storefront.d2 docs/images/blue-green-storefront.svg` -->


The stateless tiers (nginx, php-fpm, consumer) come in blue and green pairs. The **shared data layer** (RDS, Redis, MQ, OpenSearch, S3) is color-agnostic — both colors connect identically. Cron is a singleton; it reads the env config from the same Secret the active color uses.

This is the serving path only. Cluster operators (ArgoCD, Karpenter, ALB Controller), the observability stack (Alloy/Loki/Prometheus/Grafana), and the blue/green direct-QA ingresses are deliberately outside the model — their failures don't directly break HTTP serving, and adding them would multiply enumerated scenarios without diagnostic value.

### Why it looks like this

**Kubernetes components use the real resource name as the mgtt key** (`acme-shop-nginx-blue`), because the kubernetes provider's `kubectl get <type> <key>` probes resolve it directly in `default`. AWS components use readable short keys (`rds`, `redis`, `mq`) with `resource:` carrying the real AWS identifier.

**`resource: acme-shop-{env}-rds`** — templating from `meta.vars.env` means this same file ships unchanged for stage and prod; only the branch-specific `vars.env` flips.

**Random suffixes are hardcoded.** The S3 bucket `acme-shop-stage-media-8f3e9c` doesn't follow the `{env}` pattern (random bucket suffix). Same for CloudFront distribution IDs and SSM paths. Readable key + hardcoded resource is fine — the decoupling still holds.

**`scenarios: none`** on the model. The enumerated `scenarios.yaml` for this system is tens of thousands of chains — ~40MB. Too chunky for git history. Regenerate locally with `mgtt model validate --write-scenarios`, gitignore the result, and skip the drift check on this model. Hand-authored scenarios stay in `scenarios/` and run in CI via `mgtt simulate --all`.

**nginx → php-fpm is a deployment edge, not a service edge.** The `acme-shop-php-fpm-{blue,green}` Services exist in the cluster but share the Deployment's exact name — mgtt requires unique component keys, so the model walks to the deployment directly. The Deployment's `ready_replicas` / `restart_count` are what actually diagnose php-fpm health; the svc-level probe wouldn't have added signal.

**`healthy:` overrides replace the type default, they don't merge.** Three cases where that matters:

- `opensearch` — the default `deployment` type has many rules; for a single-replica staging deployment, the full set over-constrains. `ready_replicas >= 1` is the whole signal.
- `redis` — the `elasticache_cluster` default includes `cache_hit_ratio > 80`, which trips on idle stage (ratio is 0 when nothing reads). The component-level `available == true` replaces the whole rule set. A real Redis outage still flips `available` to false.
- `mq` — dropped `consumer_count > 0` from the default. On stage, consumers are scaled to 0 and never attach to the broker, so the rule flagged idle-by-design as an incident. `queue_depth < 10000` is the real safety bound: a backed-up queue is the symptom regardless of how many consumers are attached.

**Business-process components** (`scheduled_jobs`, `async_jobs`) give the engine a user-visible symptom layer for chains rooted at cron or mq. Treating them as generic components with operator-observable facts (are jobs processed on time, is the queue draining) gives mgtt a terminal to reason from.

**External Secrets Operator is modelled, not the Secret it produces.** The operator's health is the real signal — a healthy operator implies a fresh Secret. And the view-only IAM policy used by the CI diagnose role excludes `secrets`, so probing the Secret directly would 403. The operator is probed with `deployment_ready` only (not `crd_registered` or `webhook_*`), because cluster-scoped CRD gets also aren't in the view policy, and this ESO install ships no webhook configuration — setting the vars for probes that would come back forbidden just adds noise.

**The operator lives in its own namespace.** `vars.namespace: external-secrets` on that single component overrides the model-wide `meta.vars.namespace: default`, so the `kubectl -n` argument in the probe resolves correctly.

At this point the model is syntactically correct and every type/fact resolves against the declared providers. Nothing has been said yet about whether it reasons *well* — that's what scenarios are for.

---

## Scenarios

Five scenarios live in `scenarios/`, each testing a different lesson the engine has to get right.

### 1. All healthy — no false positives

`scenarios/all-healthy.yaml` injects healthy facts for every component and asserts `root_cause: none`. The moment this fails, you've added a rule that trips on a healthy system — the `consumer_count > 0` mistake gets caught here.

```yaml
name: all components healthy

inject:
  acme-shop-nginx-blue:     { ready_replicas: 2, desired_replicas: 2, condition_available: true, restart_count: 0 }
  acme-shop-nginx-green:    { ready_replicas: 2, desired_replicas: 2, condition_available: true, restart_count: 0 }
  acme-shop-php-fpm-blue:   { ready_replicas: 3, desired_replicas: 3, condition_available: true, restart_count: 0 }
  acme-shop-php-fpm-green:  { ready_replicas: 3, desired_replicas: 3, condition_available: true, restart_count: 0 }
  acme-shop-consumer-blue:  { ready_replicas: 1, desired_replicas: 1, condition_available: true, restart_count: 0 }
  acme-shop-consumer-green: { ready_replicas: 1, desired_replicas: 1, condition_available: true, restart_count: 0 }
  acme-shop-cron:           { ready_replicas: 1, desired_replicas: 1, condition_available: true, restart_count: 0 }
  opensearch:               { ready_replicas: 1, desired_replicas: 1, condition_available: true, restart_count: 0 }
  rds:                      { available: true, connection_count: 120 }
  redis:                    { available: true, connection_count: 200, cache_hit_ratio: 0.95 }
  mq:                       { available: true, consumer_count: 22, queue_depth: 34 }
  media-bucket:             { accessible: true }
  cloudfront:               { enabled: true, deployed: true }
  external-secrets:         { deployment_ready: true, crd_registered: true }

expect:
  root_cause: none
  eliminated:
    - cloudflare
    - external-secrets
    - acme-shop-ingress
    - acme-shop-nginx-blue
    - acme-shop-nginx-green
    - acme-shop-php-fpm-blue

    - mq
    - opensearch
    - rds
    - redis
    - media-bucket
    - ssm-app-config
```

### 2. Blue nginx crash-loop, green healthy

A bad image was rolled to blue nginx. Blue crash-loops, green is fine. Traffic is currently on blue, so the live path is broken — runbook here is "flip the service selector to green".

The engine sees `acme-shop-nginx-blue` degraded AND `acme-shop-nginx-green` healthy. Because `acme-shop-svc` hard-depends on both, mgtt flags `acme-shop-nginx-blue` as the root cause of the live-traffic symptom — and `acme-shop-nginx-green` gets eliminated, confirming the failover target is actually available.

```yaml
name: blue nginx crash-looping, green healthy

inject:
  acme-shop-nginx-blue:     { ready_replicas: 0, desired_replicas: 2, condition_available: false, restart_count: 18 }
  acme-shop-nginx-green:    { ready_replicas: 2, desired_replicas: 2, condition_available: true,  restart_count: 0 }
  acme-shop-svc:            { endpoint_count: 0, selector_match: false }
  acme-shop-php-fpm-blue:   { ready_replicas: 3, desired_replicas: 3, condition_available: true,  restart_count: 0 }
  acme-shop-php-fpm-green:  { ready_replicas: 3, desired_replicas: 3, condition_available: true,  restart_count: 0 }
  rds:                      { available: true, connection_count: 140 }
  redis:                    { available: true, connection_count: 200, cache_hit_ratio: 0.94 }
  mq:                       { available: true, consumer_count: 22, queue_depth: 40 }
  opensearch:               { ready_replicas: 1, desired_replicas: 1, condition_available: true, restart_count: 0 }
  media-bucket:             { accessible: true }
  external-secrets:         { deployment_ready: true, crd_registered: true }

expect:
  root_cause: acme-shop-nginx-blue
  path: [cloudflare, acme-shop-ingress, acme-shop-svc, acme-shop-nginx-blue]
  eliminated: [external-secrets, acme-shop-nginx-green, acme-shop-php-fpm-blue, acme-shop-php-fpm-green, mq, opensearch, rds, redis, media-bucket, ssm-app-config]
```

### 3. RDS unavailable — dramatic cascade

RDS stops accepting connections. php-fpm (both colors) can't load config or run catalog queries, so pods crash-loop. nginx returns 5xx. Cron and consumers are equally affected. The failure is splattered across half the dependency graph — the engine must trace it to `rds`, not blame a color.

```yaml
name: rds unavailable

inject:
  rds:                      { available: false, connection_count: 0 }
  redis:                    { available: true,  connection_count: 210, cache_hit_ratio: 0.82 }
  mq:                       { available: true,  consumer_count: 0, queue_depth: 4200 }
  opensearch:               { ready_replicas: 1, desired_replicas: 1, condition_available: true, restart_count: 0 }
  media-bucket:             { accessible: true }
  external-secrets:         { deployment_ready: true, crd_registered: true }
  acme-shop-php-fpm-blue:   { ready_replicas: 0, desired_replicas: 3, condition_available: false, restart_count: 14 }
  acme-shop-php-fpm-green:  { ready_replicas: 0, desired_replicas: 3, condition_available: false, restart_count: 12 }
  acme-shop-consumer-blue:  { ready_replicas: 0, desired_replicas: 1, condition_available: false, restart_count: 8 }
  acme-shop-consumer-green: { ready_replicas: 0, desired_replicas: 1, condition_available: false, restart_count: 9 }

expect:
  root_cause: rds
  path: [cloudflare, acme-shop-ingress, acme-shop-svc, acme-shop-nginx-blue, acme-shop-php-fpm-blue, rds]
  eliminated: [external-secrets, mq, opensearch, redis, media-bucket, ssm-app-config]
```

### 4. Redis unavailable — observability trap

This scenario tests whether the engine gets fooled. Redis goes down; sessions evict; cache hit ratio collapses. php-fpm pods stay up (they don't *require* Redis to start), but every request now hits the database — RDS connection count climbs to 480 (just under the 500 limit). If you probed naively, RDS would look *stressed*.

The engine has to recognise that `redis.available == false` is the actual failed predicate, and RDS is still within its `healthy:` bound. Root cause: `redis`.

```yaml
name: redis unavailable

inject:
  redis:                    { available: false, connection_count: 0,   cache_hit_ratio: 0.0 }
  rds:                      { available: true,  connection_count: 480 }   # stressed but within bound
  mq:                       { available: true,  consumer_count: 22,  queue_depth: 38 }
  opensearch:               { ready_replicas: 1, desired_replicas: 1, condition_available: true, restart_count: 0 }
  media-bucket:             { accessible: true }
  external-secrets:         { deployment_ready: true, crd_registered: true }
  acme-shop-php-fpm-blue:   { ready_replicas: 3, desired_replicas: 3, condition_available: true, restart_count: 1 }
  acme-shop-php-fpm-green:  { ready_replicas: 3, desired_replicas: 3, condition_available: true, restart_count: 1 }

expect:
  root_cause: redis
  path: [cloudflare, acme-shop-ingress, acme-shop-svc, acme-shop-nginx-blue, acme-shop-php-fpm-blue, redis]
  eliminated: [external-secrets, acme-shop-nginx-green, acme-shop-php-fpm-green, mq, opensearch, rds, media-bucket, ssm-app-config]
```

### 5. External Secrets Operator down — deep chain cut short

ESO's Deployment is unavailable, so the in-cluster app-config Secret can't be reconciled from SSM. php-fpm pods on both colors fail to start (mount error on a stale/missing Secret). Cron fails. Consumers can't start. The SSM parameter itself — source of truth — is fine.

The test is whether the engine cuts the chain at `external-secrets` rather than walking all the way to `ssm-app-config` and blaming it. A probe to SSM returns "ok", eliminating it. A probe to the operator's deployment returns "not ready" — that's the cut point.

```yaml
name: external-secrets operator down

inject:
  ssm-app-config:           { exists: true, version: 7 }
  external-secrets:         { deployment_ready: false, crd_registered: true, restart_count: 0 }
  rds:                      { available: true, connection_count: 100 }
  redis:                    { available: true, connection_count: 200, cache_hit_ratio: 0.93 }
  mq:                       { available: true, consumer_count: 0, queue_depth: 1800 }
  media-bucket:             { accessible: true }
  opensearch:               { ready_replicas: 1, desired_replicas: 1, condition_available: true, restart_count: 0 }
  acme-shop-php-fpm-blue:   { ready_replicas: 0, desired_replicas: 3, condition_available: false, condition_progressing: false, restart_count: 0 }
  acme-shop-php-fpm-green:  { ready_replicas: 0, desired_replicas: 3, condition_available: false, condition_progressing: false, restart_count: 0 }
  acme-shop-cron:           { ready_replicas: 0, desired_replicas: 1, condition_available: false, condition_progressing: false, restart_count: 0 }

expect:
  root_cause: external-secrets
  path: [cloudflare, acme-shop-ingress, acme-shop-svc, acme-shop-nginx-blue, acme-shop-php-fpm-blue, external-secrets]
  eliminated: [mq, opensearch, rds, redis, media-bucket, ssm-app-config]
```

Note `restart_count: 0` on the php-fpm and cron pods — a mount failure stalls the rollout before the container starts, so the pod never crashes. "Not ready, never started" is a different signature from "crash-loop", and the model's facts have to carry that distinction for the engine to cut the chain correctly.

## Simulate in CI

```
$ mgtt simulate --all

  all components healthy                        ✓ passed
  blue nginx crash-looping, green healthy       ✓ passed
  rds unavailable                               ✓ passed
  redis unavailable                             ✓ passed
  external-secrets operator down                ✓ passed

  5/5 scenarios passed
```

No cluster, no credentials. This runs on every PR in ~400ms:

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml (or .github/workflows/mgtt.yaml)
validate-model:
  image: ghcr.io/mgt-tool/mgtt:latest
  script:
    - mgtt model validate
    - mgtt simulate --all
```

Every scenario is a test of the model's *reasoning*. If someone renames `rds` to `primary-db` without updating the ingress-tier dependency, scenario 3 fails. If someone re-adds `consumer_count > 0` to the `mq` healthy rule, scenario 1 fails. The scenarios are the guard against silent drift.

## At 3am: `mgtt diagnose`

A Cloudflare alert fires: 5xx rate on `shop.acme.example` just crossed 5%. On-call pastes `/diagnose api` into Slack; a GitLab job runs:

```
$ mgtt diagnose --suspect acme-shop-php-fpm-blue --max-probes 10

  Eliminated: cloudflare, acme-shop-ingress, ssm-app-config, rds, redis
  Probes run: 9/10
  Partial visibility: none
```

Nine probes, five branches eliminated, one chain confirmed. The runbook link (not shown) points to `docs/runbooks/external-secrets-recovery.md`. On-call knows where to look before they've opened a terminal.

The reason diagnose runs this fast is the **committed `scenarios.yaml`**: at design time, `mgtt model validate --write-scenarios` enumerated every plausible failure chain this model can produce, so diagnose prunes whole branches (media-bucket, cloudfront, opensearch, mq, async_jobs, consumer/cron) with a single group-elimination step before the first live probe runs.

## Lessons from the first few weeks

Real usage of mgtt is a dialogue between the model and the system. These four refinements came from running against staging for a week before the model was trusted:

**`consumer_count > 0` on the mq_broker tripped on idle stage.** Staging often has consumer deployments at zero replicas for cost. The default `mq_broker` healthy rule flagged this as an incident on every run. The fix: component-level `healthy:` that *replaces* the default with `queue_depth < 10000`, because queue depth is the symptom an operator actually cares about regardless of consumer count. Scenario 1 (`all-healthy`) is the regression test.

**`cache_hit_ratio > 80` on idle Redis.** Same shape: on a freshly-started stage, the hit ratio is 0 because nothing's reading. The default elasticache_cluster rule flagged Redis as unhealthy while Redis was fine. Replaced with `available == true`.

**Modelling the Secret instead of the operator.** The first attempt had a `kubernetes.secret` component `app-config-active` as the dependency of php-fpm. But (a) the CI diagnose role uses a view-only IAM policy that excludes `secrets` — so the probe 403s — and (b) a stale Secret is a symptom, not a cause. The actual cause is the operator that should have refreshed it. Replacing the Secret with `external-secrets` (an `operator` component) gave the engine a probeable root cause and eliminated the 403.

**Overriding `meta.vars.namespace` per-component.** ESO lives in its own namespace, so the model-wide `default` namespace fell through to the wrong `kubectl -n` argument. The fix isn't to split the model — it's a two-line `vars: { namespace: external-secrets }` on that one component. Any other cross-namespace dependency (ALB Controller, cluster operators) would follow the same pattern.

Each of these refinements was caught by a failing scenario run, not by reading the code. The scenario file is where the engineering judgement lives — the model is the shape, the scenarios are the spec.
