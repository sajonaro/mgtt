## model guided troubleshooting tool

If you build or maintain anything with more than two components, you know the drill: something stops working, you open three terminals and start guessing.

**mgtt fixes this.** You describe your system's dependencies once in a YAML model. When something breaks, a constraint engine walks the dependency graph, probes components in order of information value, and eliminates healthy branches. It always knows what to check next and why.

And before the system even exists, you can simulate failures against the model to verify the reasoning is correct — like unit tests for your architecture.

## See it in action

### Troubleshooting at 3am: root cause in 6 probes (`mgtt plan`)

This is mgtt's reason for being. Alert fires. You run `mgtt plan` and press Y:

```
$ mgtt plan

  -> probe nginx upstream_count         ✓ nginx.upstream_count = 0   ✗ unhealthy
  -> probe api restart_count            ✓ api.restart_count = 47     ✗ unhealthy
  -> probe rds available                ✓ rds.available = true       ✓ healthy  ← eliminated
  -> probe frontend ready_replicas      ✓ frontend.ready_replicas = 2  ✓ healthy  ← eliminated

  Root cause: api
  Path:       nginx <- api
  Eliminated: frontend, rds
```

4 components probed, 2 eliminated, root cause found. The engine ranked probes by information value, so every call moved the answer forward. You didn't need to know the system — the model knew it for you.

### Autopilot: hand the loop over (`mgtt diagnose`)

Same engine, no prompts. Point it at a probe budget and a deadline:

```
$ mgtt diagnose --suspect api --max-probes 10

  ▶ probe nginx upstream_count       ✗ unhealthy
  ▶ probe api ready_replicas         ✗ unhealthy
  ▶ probe rds available              ✓ healthy  ← eliminated
  ▶ probe frontend ready_replicas    ✓ healthy  ← eliminated

  Root cause: api.degraded
  Chain:      nginx ← api
  Probes run: 4/10
```

Ideal for scheduled GitLab/GitHub Actions runs, Slack bots, LLM agents, and anywhere you want unattended root-cause analysis. Structured output is easy to parse; partial visibility (RBAC refusals, transient throttles) surfaces as a visible flag in the report rather than an abort.

### Simulation in CI: catch model drift before it matters (`mgtt simulate`)

Before the system is even running, `mgtt simulate` verifies the model's reasoning with hand-authored scenarios (`"if rds goes down and api crash-loops, root cause is rds"`). Wire it into every PR:

- **Model drift detection** — when the real system evolves (new services, renamed components, changed dependencies), a stale model silently drifts away from reality. A failing scenario tells you *before* the model is needed at 3am.
- **Architecture unit tests** — each scenario is a tiny declarative assertion. Refactor the model, break a conclusion, the suite fails. Safe renames, safe dependency moves.
- **Design-time validation** — write the model before the system exists; reason about dependency holes before building them.
- **Regression harness** — encode real incidents as scenarios. The engine must now identify that chain forever. Your postmortems become tests.

```
$ mgtt simulate --all

  rds unavailable                          ✓ passed
  api crash-loop independent of rds        ✓ passed
  frontend crash-looping, api healthy      ✓ passed
  all components healthy                   ✓ passed

  4/4 scenarios passed
```

No running system, no credentials. Runs anywhere Go runs.

## Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgt-tool/mgtt/main/install.sh | sh
```

Or: `go install github.com/mgt-tool/mgtt/cmd/mgtt@latest` | Or: `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace ghcr.io/mgt-tool/mgtt`

## Quick start

```bash
mgtt init                          # scaffold system.model.yaml
mgtt model validate                # check the model
mgtt provider install kubernetes   # install providers
mgtt simulate --all                # run failure scenarios
mgtt plan                          # troubleshoot a live system
```

**Three moments, one model:**

| | Design time | At 3am (interactive) | At 3am (autopilot) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Command | `mgtt simulate` | `mgtt plan` | `mgtt diagnose` |
| Facts from | Scenario YAML | Real probes + Y/n | Real probes, no prompts |
| Output | Pass/fail | Guided root cause | Final report + chain |

## For TLA+ users

TLA+ checks your design. mgtt checks your running system.

Same idea — write the spec, let the tool do the thinking — pointed at a different problem. When something breaks in production, mgtt walks your spec against the live cluster and tells you which component is actually broken.

- **Provider SDK** (`sdk/provider/`) — [Apache License 2.0](sdk/provider/LICENSE). Third-party providers link against this code; permissive licensing so authors can release providers under whatever licence they choose.
