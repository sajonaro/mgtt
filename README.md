## `mgtt` — **m**odel **g**uided **t**roubleshooting **t**ool

If you build or maintain anything with more than two components, you know the drill: something stops working, you open three terminals and start guessing.

**mgtt fixes this.** You describe your system's dependencies once in a YAML model. When something breaks, a constraint engine walks the dependency graph, probes components in order of information value, and eliminates healthy branches. It always knows what to check next and why.

And before the system even exists, you can simulate failures against the model to verify the reasoning is correct — like unit tests for your architecture.

## See it in action

### Simulation: catch model gaps in CI

```
$ mgtt simulate --all

  rds unavailable                          ✓ passed
  api crash-loop independent of rds        ✓ passed
  frontend crash-looping, api healthy      ✓ passed
  all components healthy                   ✓ passed

  4/4 scenarios passed
```

No running system. No credentials. Runs on every PR.

### Troubleshooting: root cause in 6 probes

Monday 3am. Alert fires. You run `mgtt plan` and press Y:

```
$ mgtt plan

  -> probe nginx upstream_count         ✓ nginx.upstream_count = 0   ✗ unhealthy
  -> probe api restart_count            ✓ api.restart_count = 47     ✗ unhealthy
  -> probe rds available                ✓ rds.available = true       ✓ healthy  ← eliminated
  -> probe frontend ready_replicas      ✓ frontend.ready_replicas = 2  ✓ healthy  ← eliminated

  Root cause: api
  Path:       nginx <- api
  Eliminated: frontend, rds
```

4 components probed, 2 eliminated, root cause found. You didn't need to know the system — the model knew it for you.

## Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajonaro/mgtt/main/install.sh | sh
```

Or: `go install github.com/sajonaro/mgtt/cmd/mgtt@latest` | Or: `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace ghcr.io/sajonaro/mgtt`

## Quick start

```bash
mgtt init                          # scaffold system.model.yaml
mgtt model validate                # check the model
mgtt provider install kubernetes   # install providers
mgtt simulate --all                # run failure scenarios
mgtt plan                          # troubleshoot a live system
```

**Two modes, same model:**

| | Design time | At 3am |
|---|---|---|
| Command | `mgtt simulate` | `mgtt plan` |
| Facts from | Scenario YAML | Real probes (kubectl, aws) |
| Output | Pass/fail assertions | Guided root cause |
