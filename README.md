## Your architecture, executable.

You already draw the diagram — components, dependencies, what "healthy" means. mgtt reads it as code. One YAML model drives two modes:

- **At design time**, `mgtt simulate` injects synthetic failures and asserts the engine reaches the right conclusion. Runs in CI on every PR. Catches architectural drift before the diagram lies to you.
- **At 3am**, `mgtt diagnose` runs the same engine against the live system. Real probes replace the synthetic facts. It names the broken component, eliminates the healthy ones, and hands you the chain.

Same model. Same reasoning. Two fixture sources.

```
$ mgtt diagnose --suspect api

  ▶ probe nginx upstream_count       ✗ unhealthy
  ▶ probe api ready_replicas         ✗ unhealthy
  ▶ probe rds available              ✓ healthy  ← eliminated
  ▶ probe frontend ready_replicas    ✓ healthy  ← eliminated

  Root cause: api.degraded
  Chain:      nginx ← api
  Probes run: 4
```

The engine picks probes by information value, so every call rules out a branch. You didn't need to know the system — the model knew it for you. Partial visibility (RBAC refusals, transient throttles) surfaces as a flag, not an abort.

## Architecture

![mgtt architecture](docs/images/architecture.svg)

mgtt core reasons; adapters translate to backend-specific commands; the registry publishes them. Credentials live only in the adapter layer — the engine never touches them. See [How It Works](./docs/concepts/how-it-works.md#architecture-at-a-glance) for the surrounding prose.
